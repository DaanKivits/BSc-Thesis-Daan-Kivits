The ocean's energy- andC-cycle under climatechange:A 1-D modelling study

All of the SMD files are model files which can be imported into SMART (Simulation and Modelling Assistant for Research and Training), a computer 
executable made by Mark S. Kramer (see: http://harmoniqua.wur.nl/smart/)

The basic model used from the start is present under the filename 'OceanCarbonateChemistry.smd'. The other files are all final versions 
of the modelling framework, and updated for each of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) climate scenarios.
